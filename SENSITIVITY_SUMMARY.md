# Key Sensitivities Analysis Summary

### Textual Summary (150-200 words)

Our financial model reveals that Oasis Browser is most sensitive to B2B pilot execution and developer cost management, with pricing and usage intensity playing important but secondary roles. The following insights guide our strategic priorities:

• **B2B Pilots Drive Revenue Scale:** The number of B2B pilot contracts has the largest impact on total revenue, with a range from $73K (0 pilots) to $573K (10 pilots)—a 7.8x variance. This makes B2B sales execution the primary growth lever, requiring focused resources on pilot development, conversion, and expansion.

• **Developer Cost Management is Critical for B2B Margins:** Developer hourly costs directly compress B2B margins, dropping from 81% at $40/hour to 65.6% at $80/hour—a 15 percentage point impact. Maintaining cost discipline through efficient delivery, scope management, and potentially lower-cost resources is essential for preserving B2B profitability.

• **Pricing Has Moderate Revenue Impact:** Subscription price changes from $15 to $25 drive a 12% revenue variance ($305K to $341K), with higher prices also improving margins. This suggests pricing optimization can meaningfully improve unit economics without significantly impacting demand, particularly for knowledge workers who value productivity gains.

• **Usage Intensity Affects Margins More Than Revenue:** While usage intensity doesn't change revenue (users pay the same subscription), it directly impacts costs and margins. Heavy usage (150% of allowance) compresses margins by 3.5 percentage points compared to light usage (50%), highlighting the importance of usage monitoring and potentially tiered pricing for power users.

• **Churn Has Moderate but Manageable Impact:** Churn rates from 3% to 15% create a 9% revenue variance, with lower churn improving both revenue and runway. This reinforces the importance of onboarding, user education, and retention programs, though churn is less sensitive than B2B execution.

• **Two-Way Interactions Reveal Optimization Opportunities:** The interaction between subscribers and usage intensity shows that scale with moderate usage maximizes margins. Similarly, B2B margins remain stable across pilot counts when developer costs are controlled, suggesting we can scale B2B efficiently with proper cost management.

**Strategic Implications:** Focus resources on B2B pilot execution and developer cost efficiency as primary growth and margin drivers. Optimize pricing within the $20-$25 range to improve unit economics. Monitor usage patterns and implement usage management strategies to protect margins. Maintain strong retention programs, but prioritize B2B growth as the highest-impact lever.
