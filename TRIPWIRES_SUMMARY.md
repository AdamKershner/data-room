### Threshold Definitions

1. **Minimum Cash Threshold: $100,000**
   - Ensures sufficient runway buffer for operational flexibility
   - Provides 2-3 months of operating expenses as safety margin

2. **Minimum Gross Margin: 60%**
   - Protects unit economics and ensures sustainable business model
   - Allows for operating expenses and future growth investments

3. **Maximum Monthly Burn: $50,000**
   - Aligns with fundraising and runway planning
   - Ensures controlled cash consumption while scaling

### Scenario Performance

**All scenarios maintain all thresholds with no violations:**

- **Conservative:** $303K min cash, 73.7% margin, $13.7K max burn
- **Base:** $470K min cash, 81.0% margin, positive cash flow
- **Aggressive:** $572K min cash, 82.8% margin, positive cash flow

### Pre-Defined Actions

**If Minimum Cash Breached:**
- Slow hiring and reduce marketing spend
- Prioritize B2B revenue generation

**If Gross Margin Below 60%:**
- Optimize AI costs and improve usage efficiency
- Adjust pricing or implement tiered pricing for power users

**If Monthly Burn Exceeds $50K:**
- Implement hiring freeze
- Shift focus to revenue-generating activities

### Summary Bullets (Ready for Business Plan)

• **Minimum Cash Threshold ($100,000):** Ensures sufficient runway buffer for operational flexibility. All scenarios maintain cash above this threshold, with Conservative case showing $303K minimum (Dec 2026) and Base/Aggressive cases maintaining higher balances throughout the year.

• **Minimum Gross Margin (60%):** Protects unit economics and ensures sustainable business model. All scenarios exceed this threshold, with margins ranging from 73.7% (Conservative) to 82.8% (Aggressive), demonstrating strong unit economics across all cases.

• **Maximum Monthly Burn ($50,000):** Aligns with fundraising and runway planning. Conservative scenario shows no violations, while Base and Aggressive scenarios achieve positive cash flow, eliminating burn concerns entirely.

• **Conservative Scenario:** Maintains all thresholds with $303K minimum cash, 73.7% gross margin, and controlled burn. No violations occur, though margins are lower due to limited B2B traction.

• **Base Scenario:** Exceeds all thresholds with $470K minimum cash, 81.0% gross margin, and positive cash flow. Demonstrates balanced execution with strong financial health.

• **Aggressive Scenario:** Strongest performance across all metrics with $572K minimum cash, 82.8% gross margin, and significant positive cash flow. No threshold violations, indicating room for accelerated growth.

• **Actions if Thresholds Hit:** If minimum cash is breached, slow hiring and reduce marketing spend while prioritizing B2B revenue. If gross margin falls below 60%, optimize AI costs, adjust pricing, or improve usage efficiency. If monthly burn exceeds $50K, implement hiring freeze and shift focus to revenue-generating activities.

• **Risk Mitigation:** The model shows strong resilience across scenarios, with all cases maintaining healthy financial metrics. The primary focus should be on B2B execution to maximize revenue while maintaining cost discipline to protect margins.
