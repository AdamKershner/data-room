### Funding Analysis Table

| Scenario | Round Size | Post-Round Runway (months) | Next Raise Month |
|----------|------------|---------------------------|------------------|
| Conservative | $500K | 111.8 | Q3 2027 |
| Conservative | $750K | 142.8 | Q4 2027 |
| Conservative | $1M | 173.9 | Q5 2027 |
| Base | $500K | ∞ | Beyond 2027 |
| Base | $750K | ∞ | Beyond 2027 |
| Base | $1M | ∞ | Beyond 2027 |
| Aggressive | $500K | ∞ | Beyond 2027 |
| Aggressive | $750K | ∞ | Beyond 2027 |
| Aggressive | $1M | ∞ | Beyond 2027 |

### Why $750K is the Optimal Round Size

A $750,000 raise provides the optimal balance between runway extension and milestone achievement. In the base scenario, this funding extends runway beyond 2027 while maintaining positive cash flow, eliminating the need for an immediate follow-on round. Even in the conservative scenario with limited B2B traction, $750K provides 142.8 months of runway, ensuring we can reach key milestones before the next raise. The aggressive scenario achieves positive cash flow with any round size, but $750K provides sufficient buffer for accelerated growth initiatives.

### Key Milestones Reachable Before Next Raise

• **Revenue Milestones:** With $750K, we can reach $323K-$669K in annual revenue (Base to Aggressive scenarios), demonstrating strong product-market fit and scalable unit economics. This revenue level provides multiple options for the next round, including profitability or significant growth trajectory.

• **B2C Subscriber Growth:** Achieve 461-775 paying subscribers (Base to Aggressive), validating the B2C2B model and creating a foundation of individual users who can become champions for enterprise adoption.

• **B2B Pilot Execution:** Execute 5-10 B2B pilot contracts, demonstrating enterprise value proposition and creating a pipeline for multi-team and org-wide expansion. Successful pilots at this scale validate the B2B model and provide case studies for future sales.

• **Product Development:** Launch key features including expanded command coverage, team collaboration tools, enterprise-grade security, and integrations with knowledge management and project management platforms. These features support both B2C retention and B2B expansion.

• **Team Building:** Hire key roles in engineering, sales/BD, and customer success to support growth trajectory. With $750K, we can build the team needed to execute on both B2C and B2B fronts while maintaining runway flexibility.

• **Market Validation:** Demonstrate strong unit economics (73.7%-82.8% gross margins across scenarios) and positive cash flow in Base/Aggressive cases, positioning the company for a strong Series A or growth round with favorable terms.

### Use of Funds Breakdown (Recommended Allocation)

- **Engineering & Product Development:** 40% ($300K) - Core product features, team collaboration, enterprise security
- **Go-to-Market (Marketing/Sales):** 25% ($187.5K) - B2C acquisition, B2B pilot development, content marketing
- **AI/Infrastructure Costs:** 15% ($112.5K) - Scaling AI services, AWS infrastructure, usage growth
- **Team & Operations:** 15% ($112.5K) - Key hires (engineering, sales, customer success)
- **Runway Buffer:** 5% ($37.5K) - Contingency and operational flexibility

### Strategic Rationale

The $750K round size is calibrated to our base-case assumptions while providing resilience in conservative scenarios. It extends runway beyond 2027 in base and aggressive cases (eliminating immediate fundraising pressure) while providing 142.8 months of runway even in the conservative case. This allows us to focus on execution and milestone achievement rather than constant fundraising, while maintaining flexibility to accelerate if we outperform base assumptions.
