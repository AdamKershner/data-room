# Meeting Preparation: Answers to Key Questions

## Question 1: Which assumptions are most exposed to external factors or market uncertainty?

Based on our sensitivity analysis, the following assumptions are most vulnerable to external market forces:

### **Most Exposed Assumptions:**

1. **Monthly Churn Rate (7% base case)**
   - **External Factors:** Competitive landscape (new AI browsers entering market), economic conditions affecting discretionary spending, product quality relative to alternatives
   - **Market Uncertainty:** We're assuming 7% monthly churn, but this could swing to 3-15% based on competitive dynamics and product-market fit validation
   - **Impact:** 9% revenue variance ($305K to $336K) - moderate but meaningful
   - **Mitigation:** Strong onboarding, retention programs, and continuous product improvement to maintain competitive position

2. **New Subscribers Per Month (50/month base case)**
   - **External Factors:** Marketing channel effectiveness, competition for attention, economic conditions affecting adoption, product awareness in market
   - **Market Uncertainty:** Range of 20-100/month depending on organic traction, paid acquisition effectiveness, and market receptivity
   - **Impact:** Directly compounds over time - affects ending subscriber count significantly
   - **Mitigation:** We have existing organic traction (818K Google Search impressions, 87% increase), but need to validate conversion rates and scale paid channels once LTV is proven

3. **Number of B2B Pilots (5 base case)**
   - **External Factors:** Enterprise sales cycles, budget availability, competitive solutions, economic conditions affecting enterprise software spend
   - **Market Uncertainty:** Range of 0-10 pilots depending on sales execution, market timing, and enterprise appetite for productivity tools
   - **Impact:** **Largest revenue impact** - 7.8x variance ($73K to $573K total revenue)
   - **Mitigation:** We have identified champions (Jonathan Gans at Angellist, PE/VC prospects, Deloitte/McKinsey contacts) and are building relationships through alumni networks and conferences

4. **Developer Hourly Cost ($40/hour base case)**
   - **External Factors:** Labor market conditions, developer supply/demand, geographic hiring strategy
   - **Market Uncertainty:** Could range from $40-$80/hour depending on talent market and hiring approach
   - **Impact:** 15 percentage point margin compression (81% to 65.6% B2B margin)
   - **Mitigation:** Efficient delivery processes, scope management, potentially lower-cost geographic resources

5. **API Costs (Gemini/Deepgram pricing)**
   - **External Factors:** AI provider pricing changes, usage-based tier adjustments, competitive pricing pressure
   - **Market Uncertainty:** Current costs ($0.002/text, $0.016/voice) could change with provider pricing strategy
   - **Impact:** Affects gross margins, especially for heavy users (150% of allowance)
   - **Mitigation:** Monitor usage patterns, potentially negotiate volume discounts, consider multi-provider strategy

### **Less Exposed (More Controllable):**

- **Subscription Price:** We control this, though market receptivity affects demand
- **Usage Intensity:** User behavior-driven, but we can influence through product design
- **Starting Subscribers:** Historical data point, less uncertain

## Question 2: What are the top one or two outcomes you personally care most about getting right?

### **1. B2B Pilot Execution (5 pilots in 2026)**

**Why this matters most:**
- **Revenue Impact:** B2B pilots represent the largest revenue lever (7.8x variance in total revenue)
- **Validation:** Successfully closing 5 pilots validates enterprise value proposition and B2B model
- **Path to Scale:** Pilots create case studies, reference customers, and expansion opportunities
- **Strategic Positioning:** Demonstrates product-market fit beyond individual users to organizational value

**What "getting it right" means:**
- Close 5 pilot contracts at $50K/year average
- Maintain 80% gross margins through efficient delivery (250 hours/pilot at $40/hour)
- Achieve pilot success metrics (time saved, reduced context switching, user satisfaction)
- Convert pilots to multi-team or org-wide deals for expansion

**How we're tracking:**
- Pipeline development through champions (Jonathan Gans, PE/VC firms, consulting firms)
- Champion discovery via alumni networks and in-person conferences
- Pilot design with clear success metrics and 3-6 month timelines
- Focus on knowledge-heavy organizations (50-500 employees) in software, consulting, research

### **2. Gross Margin Sustainability (Target: 80%+)**

**Why this matters most:**
- **Unit Economics:** High margins validate business model and enable sustainable growth
- **Investor Confidence:** Strong margins demonstrate efficient operations and pricing power
- **Runway Extension:** Higher margins improve cash flow and extend runway
- **Competitive Moat:** Maintaining margins while scaling shows operational excellence

**What "getting it right" means:**
- B2C: Maintain 80%+ gross margins despite usage variability (currently 79.3% to 82.8% range)
- B2B: Maintain 80% gross margins by controlling developer costs ($40/hour target)
- Monitor usage patterns to prevent margin compression from heavy users
- Optimize pricing within $20-$25 range to balance demand and margins

**How we're tracking:**
- Monthly margin monitoring across B2C and B2B
- Usage intensity tracking to identify heavy users early
- Developer cost discipline in B2B delivery
- Pricing optimization based on demand elasticity

**Why these two over others:**
- **B2B Execution** is the highest-impact growth lever and validates enterprise strategy
- **Gross Margins** ensure sustainable unit economics and demonstrate business model strength
- Together, they show both growth potential and operational efficiency - key for investor confidence

## Question 3: How are you thinking about approaching 5 B2B deals - target customers and go-to-market strategy?

### **Target Customer Profile (ICP)**

**Company Characteristics:**
- **Size:** 50-500 employees (knowledge-heavy organizations)
- **Verticals:** Software, consulting, research, professional services
- **Key Roles:** Teams with multi-tab workflows, remote/distributed teams
- **Pain Points:** Context switching, productivity loss, browser management overhead

**Why this ICP:**
- Knowledge workers who spend 60-80% of workday in browsers
- Organizations that value productivity tools and ROI measurement
- Size allows for pilot programs without complex enterprise procurement
- Champions can drive adoption within organizations

### **Go-to-Market Strategy**
