# Oasis — Final YouTube Video List (Priority Order)

Built from:
- **Current YouTube keyword ranking**: `keyword_ranking_youtube.csv` (highest `yt_score` first)
- **Google Trends exploration**: `Google Trends.md` + `oasis_youtube_topics_from_google_trends.md`

This version is tuned for a **balanced goal**: **B2C traction + enterprise pipeline**.

## Priority logic (balanced)

- **Lead with category waves** (Copilot/Gemini, “AI in browsers”) to earn B2C reach.
- **Thread in enterprise authority early** (managed browser, Zero Trust, RBI, SWG, DLP, SSO) to build pipeline.
- **Keep a few “how-to” traffic magnets**, but rewrite them as **Oasis workflow demos** (commands/voice + tab groups + splitview) so they build the brand, not just views.
