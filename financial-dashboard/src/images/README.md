# Product Images

This folder contains product images that can be incorporated into various parts of the financial dashboard.

## Usage

To use images from this folder in your React components, import them like this:

```jsx
import productImage from '../images/your-image-name.jpg'

// Then use in JSX:
<img src={productImage} alt="Product screenshot" />
```

## Supported Formats

- JPG/JPEG

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `oasis-browser-dashboard.png` instead of `image1.png`)
- Optimize images before uploading to keep file sizes reasonable
