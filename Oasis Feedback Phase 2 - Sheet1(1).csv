R7vApd,75P7ea,2025-03-04 21:08:01,,"Things I didn't like and observations while using:
1. When setting up, you need to login for the first time from within the hub after you save it. Recommendation would be to save the login screens of key apps (JIRA, Figma, etc.) into hubs and then access
2. I was thinking about notifications from applications and sites within the browser. However, I think it would make sense to configure notifications for those individually and not have browser notifications for now
3. Slack browser-based version was a bit slow to load compared to the application, but that's okay
4. Be prepared for a lot of 2-factor authentication if you're first setting up your Oasis work environment
5. While tagging Sites and adding them to hubs, I mainly added tags that were related to the name of the article or thing. For example, I did a ""Grok"" tag for ""Grok""
6. I noticed that some sites like Grok and Notion do not load and may only be available on specific browsers
7. I found myself relying on the ai buddy a lot rather than remember where each site was saved",,,,,,,adam@kahana.co
